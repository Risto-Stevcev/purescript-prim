# purescript-prim

Pseudo-package for documenting the primitive types defined by the PureScript
compiler. You shouldn't depend on this package if you're writing PureScript
code; if you do, you'll probably get a "Module defined multiple times" error.

The released versions match up with versions of the PureScript compiler.
